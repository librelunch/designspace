# Decisions

This file is an interpretation log for genuine gaps in `API.md`. It is not a general ADR
diary, progress log, or place to justify divergence from a clear requirement.

When a question is resolved, update `API.md` so future work no longer depends on reading
the historical entry. Keep the entry here to preserve why the answer was chosen.

## Entry template

Copy this template for each genuine specification gap.

```markdown
## D-71 — Short title

- Status: Open | Resolved
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Spec section: API.md §...
- Decided by: User | Agent | Pending

### Question

The exact question that the specification does not answer.

### Why the specification is insufficient

The conflicting readings or missing information that prevent a justified answer.

### Possibilities considered

1. **Possibility A.** Observable consequences and trade-offs.
2. **Possibility B.** Observable consequences and trade-offs.

### Answer

The selected interpretation, or `Pending` while the entry remains open.

### Reasoning

Why this answer best fits the stated scope and invariants.

### Specification update

The `API.md` section changed after resolution, or `Pending`.
